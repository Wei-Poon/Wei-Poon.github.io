          <p class="half">For this project, students were tasked to cover an event or practice that spread misinformation, both intentionally or otherwise. As a result, I chose to create a series of biographical websites exploring the careers of prolific Super Smash Bros. players and their involvement in harassment scandals.</p>
          <p class="half">Each page is split into two halves that can be toggled by a button: the first covers the player’s legacy – the second covers the allegations made against them and their individual responses. Stylistically the outcome draws inspiration from traditional athletes websites.</p>

          <p class="half">Outcome for a type-based brief. Instead of referring to traditional articles, I chose YouTube video essays as the source of my content. As a result, the website’s aethetics are heavily influenced by YouTube’s visual identity. <br><br> The essays themselves were derived from a series of user Jacob Geller’s videos that discussed the topics of graphics and art direction in video games. This informed my choice of project title, “The Digital Aesthetic.”</p>

In association with Alan Truong, Cindy Nguyen and Tyler Foley, we completely overhauled the team’s previous brand identity, known as the Volleyroos. <br><br> My contributions towards the redesign largely involved reinvigorating interest in the brand’s online platforms. This included traditional social media pages and pursuing new avenues such as live-streaming services.</p>

To respond to the brief, i collected images of unique structures found across the world. <br><br> To diversify the website,I wanted to explore outside the boundaries of traditional image galleries. As a result, I included more functionality allowing users to interact with items.</p>

          <p class="half">With this additional interactivity, users are encouraged to utilise the website as a canvas to create their own "Dynamic City-Scape." <br><br> Of course, the website can still function as an independent image gallery. Items are categorised under six different sub-groups and hovering over them will provide additional details.</p>
