          <p class="noindent">Cinnamon “Cinnpie” Dunson is a professional Espsorts caster known for her commentary in the Smash community. Based in Virginia, Cinnpie has commentated at a number of premier tournaments such as EVO 2019.</p>
          <p>Before her work as a commentator, Cinnpie competed in pro-amateur Smash 4 tournaments and became known for her high placements in the doubles tournaments. Alongside her longtime doubles partner, WaDi, Cinnpie frequently attended and placed within the top 3 duos of these tournaments.</p>
          <p class="last">During the shift to competitive Smash Ultimate, Cinnpie continued to attend pro-amateur tournaments. However, her interests began shifting from competing to commentary. Her proficiency as a caster for the game eventually gave way to her appearance at several national tournaments as a featured commentator.</p>

        <div class="text">
          <p>On July 1st, 2020, the Smash community experienced a wave of sexual misconduct allegations regarding high profile members. The first of these allegations was made against Cinnpie, accusing her of sexual predation of an, at the time, underaged, community member.</p>
          <p>The allegation quickly gained traction within the community and many members began referencing archival footage to support the claim. Several members of the local Virginia scene have also come foward to reveal their accounts of Cinnpie leveraging her sexuality for personal gain.</p>
          <p class="last">Following the community-wide backlash, Cinnpie has removed herself from all public online activity. Regarding the allegations, she has yet to make a response.</p>
