          <p class="noindent">Nairoby "Nairo" Quezada, born on November 7th, 1996, is a top competitor in the Brawl, Smash 4 and Ultimate eras. Based in Passaic, New Jersey, Nairo initially gained recognition throughout the community following his impressive showing at Apex 2012, eliminating players such as Yuta "Nietono" Uejima. In the preceding years, Nairo would slowly work his way up to be amongst the best of Brawl. Many considered him the best Brawl player at the end of the game's lifespan.</p>
          <p>With the release of Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, Nairo remained a top player, frequently placing high at premier tournaments. A year after the game's release, Nairo made history as the only player to defeat ZeRo in 2015, ending the latter's 56 tournament win streak.</p>
          <p class="last">In the transition into Smash Ultimate, Nairo continued to place high in early tournaments. Relegating his Smash 4 main, Zero Suit Samus, to secondary, Nairo picked up Palutena as his Ultimate main and quickly became renowned as the best Palutena player in the world.</p>

          The<br>Victim?
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p>On July 1st, 2020, the Smash community experienced a wave of sexual misconduct allegations regarding high profile members. One of the allegations that surfaced accused Nairo of initiating sexual interactions with a minor.</p>
          <p>The allegation received quick support from many prominent community members. It would also come to light that Nairo resorted to bribery as a form of damage control.</p>
          <p class="last">Months following the inital allegation, however, Nairo made an official statement refuting the original claims. Having collected a 30-page document with evidence, Nairo planned to take legal action and began receiving support from the community.</p>
